Design Process, User Testing, and Iterative Design

Design Process:
	- Our design process is logged onto this google doc:
	https://docs.google.com/document/d/1J7Tom5xQx5yerUZ4feDtwu15hFatSwYCkOkzDR8a_2I/edit

	- We started out with possible looks of different pages on the
	customer app
	- We then looked into how the user would want to see/search for
	products and navigate through the pages.
	- Comparative analysis was done with other similar apps that allowed
	users to order things and checkout (ie: orderpitt.com, groupon.com,
	grubhub.com), as well as websites with similar purposes with farms
	(ie: wholefoods.com, localharvest.org).
	- Looking at the vastness of this project, we decided to focus on the
	customer mobile app, and just create a simple farmer app due to the
	limited time we had before the semester ended.


User Testing:
	After getting a simple structure of our app going, we did some user
	testing.
	Feedback is listed below (Followed by hopeful fixes in
	parenthesis):
	- Separate the customer and farmer into two separate apps. (Don't 
	have page that lets you choose if you're a farmer or customer)
	- It is hard to tell how to add a product to the cart. We only had
	input fields of amount to purchase, but no button. (Add a button)
	- The footer moves up everytime the keyboard appears. Takes up too
	much of the screen. (Keep footer fixed to bottom of screen even
	if keyboard appears)
	- It'd be a nice functionality to have sales/featured items show up
	on the search/browse page. (Not sure if we will get to this...)
	- The login page takes me directly to checkout page sometimes. (This
	is because when the user was in the checkout page and needed to Sign in
	before checking out, he no longer wanted to checkout and continued
	browsing pages then logged in afterwards.)
